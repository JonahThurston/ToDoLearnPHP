I made this app because I got a job interview with a company that uses the Lamp stack. So I gotta learn PHP asap.

This was made using XAMPP as a starting spot. Put this in the htdocs file of that and it should work.

I could make this app have a lot nicer UI and UX. But that would just be a buncha js and css work, and I already know how to do that. Its not specific to LAMP. So meh, its icky looking and kinda silly. But it works! Yay full stack app!
